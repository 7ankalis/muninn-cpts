# Metasploit

{% hint style="warning" %}
Metasploit is a powerful automated tool we can use responsibly in order to get to our targets. It is important to understand its structure to use it to the fullest. I mean if it is automated and took off a "hard" part of our attack, we should at least know how to use it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is important to note that this tool is too powerful in lateral movement, especially in Dante pro Lab. Really important information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is important to note that payloads and exploits HIGHLY depends on the target's environment, architecture. Etc since it is based on the return addresses of the functions and registers so at times we will be crafting our own.

These are the base files for the Framework:

* Data and Lib are the functioning part of msfconsole interface.
* Documentation is pretty self explanatory.

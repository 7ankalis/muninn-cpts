## About

Web reconnaissance is the initial phase of a web application penetration test, where attackers or penetration testers gather information about the target system. The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities by collecting data with and without interacting directly with the target in a noticeable way.

### Web reconnaissance types:

Web reconnaissance is divided into two major types: active and passive reconnaissance and each approach offers distinct advantages and challenges.

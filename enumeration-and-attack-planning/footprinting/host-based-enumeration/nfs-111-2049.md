# NFS(111,2049)

## About

Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. Kind of forking a copy on your device without actually saving it. \


No direct communication between NFS clients and SMB servers.Needs the user's authentication.

Newer NFS versions work only on TCP/UDP port 2049 which simplifies the use of the protocol across firewalls.&#x20;

Also, NFS uses TCP/UDP port 111 : This is the port for the RPC portmapper (also known as rpcbind), which maps RPC program numbers to network port numbers. NFS uses RPC, so the portmapper is essential for the initial communication.

NFS also uses dynamic ports assigned by the portmapper for various RPC services such as:

* **mountd**: The mount daemon, which assists with mounting NFS file systems.
* **nlockmgr**: The network lock manager, which manages file locking.
* **statd**: The status monitor daemon, which handles crash recovery.
* **rquotad**: The remote quota server daemon, which provides disk quota management.

## Config

## Enumeration

### Nmap

We can see how NFS is entangled to RPC through a simple nmap scan:

```bash
$sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC

### Mounting/Unmounting and interacting with NFS

```bash
$ mkdir target-NFS
$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.10.10:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
$ cd target-NFS
$ tree .

.
└── mnt
    └── nfs
        ├── id_rsa
        ├── id_rsa.pub
        └── nfs.share

2 directories, 3 files
$ cd ..
$ sudo umount ./target-NFS
```

# Footprinting

{% hint style="info" %}
For me this was one of the heaviest modules in the path. As someone with no prior experience and knowledge with these protocols,  I really took my time, a lot of It, to really get the point of it not just spam the commands to get the flag at the assessments.

And I don't regret it a bit even tho it took me much longer than the expected time.&#x20;

This section is all about common protocols we will run into in HTB labs, and an actual pentest.&#x20;

For each protocol, here's how it goes:

* Some non technical information about how the protocol actually works and how it is related to what we're used to use as end users (for example the imap/pop3 part and how it is related to the mailing we're used to).
* Few configuration notes and settings for the specific server for each service/protocol (To be configured and published once the CPTS path is complete)
* And of course the footprinting techniques the modules provide.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
While the courses and modules provide a solid foundation for understanding various protocols, it is crucial to recognize that they may not cover every nuance or detail. \
We strongly advise you not to rely solely on the course content. Instead, supplement your learning by conducting further research, exploring reputable sources, and using search engines to deepen your understanding. \
Naturally, real-world applications often involve complexities not fully captured in materials, so doing your own research is your way to go.

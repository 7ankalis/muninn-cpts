# What is Huginn Notes ?

#### Why Huginn Notes?

Inspired by Huginn and Muninn, the ravens from Norse mythology who travel the world gathering knowledge for Odin, we see pentesting as a similar journey—exploring, gathering information, and uncovering insights.

As newcomers, we’ve often struggled to find clear, beginner-friendly resources. While there are plenty of excellent notes, cheatsheets, and guides created by experts, they often lack an all-in-one format tailored to someone just starting out. The search for the right information can easily become frustrating and time-consuming. That’s why we created Huginn Notes.

#### Our Goal

We are beginners helping beginners. Through Huginn Notes, we aim to simplify the challenges we faced early on and provide a guiding hand for others starting their journey. Here’s how:

1. **Beginner-Centric Approach:** We’ve curated walkthroughs, write-ups, and notes based on our experience with the CPTS Job Role Path and other resources, designed specifically with beginners in mind.
2. **Teaching the Process:** Instead of just presenting information, we emphasize how to research effectively and how to get the most out of platforms like HTB. These modules are packed with high-quality material but can be intimidating for someone starting fresh. We aim to fill the gaps and guide you through the learning curve.
3. **Breaking Down Complexity:** We focus on simplifying challenging concepts through clear explanations and visual aids to make them easier to understand and remember.

Huginn Notes is for those taking their first steps in pentesting. We’ve been where you are, and we’re here to share what we’ve learned, help you build confidence, and make your pentesting journey as smooth as possible.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">A Word of Caution</mark>

* Our notes should **NEVER** be taken for granted! Just because something works in a specific scenario doesn’t mean it will work everywhere or every time.
* Always consult additional resources and cross-check your findings. In pentesting, there’s always more to learn—and that’s what makes this field so fascinating.

## Why How I Met Your Shell?

As newcomers, we’ve often struggled to find clear, beginner-friendly resources. While there are plenty of excellent notes, cheatsheets, and guides created by experts, they often lack an all-in-one format tailored to someone just starting out. The search for the right information can easily become frustrating and time-consuming. That’s why we created HIMYSH. We believe that we're good at taking notes and getting the most out of whatever thing we do, so here we are!

## Our Goal

We are beginners helping beginners. Through HIMYSH, we aim to simplify the challenges we faced early on and provide a guiding hand for others starting their journey. Here’s how:

1. **Beginner-Centric Approach:** We’ve curated walkthroughs, write-ups, and notes based on our experience with the HackTheBox CPTS Job Role Path and other resources, designed specifically with beginners in mind.
2. **Teaching the Process:** Instead of just presenting information, we emphasize how to research effectively and how to get the most out of platforms like HTB. These modules are packed with high-quality material but can be intimidating for someone starting fresh. We aim to fill the gaps and guide you through the learning curve.
3. **Breaking Down Complexity:** We focus on simplifying challenging concepts through clear explanations and visual aids to make them easier to understand and remember.

HIMYSH is for us beginners and could be an example of a note-taking methodology of whatever pentesting course you're pursuing.

And of course my way of building my portfolio :smile:

* Our notes should **NEVER** be taken for granted! Just because something works in a specific scenario doesn’t mean it will work everywhere or every time.&#x20;
* Always consult additional resources and cross-check your findings. In pentesting, there’s always more to learn—and that’s what makes this field so fascinating.
* I say "we" but It is actually an ' I ' but hopefully this project builds up to something bigger.
